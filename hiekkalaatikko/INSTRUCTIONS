How to run the software:
Start roscore and all the other hardware:
roslaunch AS-84.3144.launch pioneer.launch

start the mapping server and navigation stack. Go to robot's ~/g2 folder and run:
roslaunch gui_plannerz.launch
(you could run the stack from this repo, but it doesn't have the latest version, so use the one already in the robot)

Download repo, and go to the hiekkalaatikko folder

start the GUI in gui_plannerz/src folder:
./mcgui.py

start pirate detector in pirate_detector/src folder:
./pirate_detector.py
